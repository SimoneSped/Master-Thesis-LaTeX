Bit of history (maybe)
Dust modeling
Modified Black-body
-> In order to reduce the number of observables needed to carry out column density (N), measurements are carried out the in Rayleigh-Jeans Regime ($h\nu << k_B T$). For typical dust temperature the RJ regime corresponds to (sub-mm wavelengths).
