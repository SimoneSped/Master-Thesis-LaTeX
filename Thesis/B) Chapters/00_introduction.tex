GMCs

Star forms in the coldest and highest col. density material

Dust grain properties -> Cloud properties from dust emission

In order to reduce the number of observables needed to carry out column density (N), measurements are carried out the in Rayleigh-Jeans Regime ($h\nu << k_B T$). For typical dust temperature the RJ regime corresponds to (sub-mm wavelengths).
