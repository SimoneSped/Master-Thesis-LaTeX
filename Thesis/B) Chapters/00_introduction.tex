% List the goals of the thesis, roter faden!
The goals of this master thesis are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item extract and preprocess the relevant data
    \item use topological methods to characterize the GMCs
    \item further explore the fractal dimension framework to describe in detail the physics of the cloud
    \item connect these properties to scaling relations and star formation properties.
\end{itemize}
