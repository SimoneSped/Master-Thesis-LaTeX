Global Fractal Dimension 
Orion B is more turbulent and we can defo see that 
Orion A double fit -> the changing point is where stars from
We see that point also in the Euler Characteristic
Less so in Orion B, this gives a coherent picture of how the Minkowski functionals can describe the physics of the cloud.
Reference that one paper for the local fractal dimension

comparison with the M**alpha method

Star Formation: method a bit limited by the number and extent of the objects.
